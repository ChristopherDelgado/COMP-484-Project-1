            <p>
                The Shift slab allows the player to teleport to a close location. This is very similar to an
                ability in one of Arkane Studios other games
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dishonored">Dishonored</a> blink. There is also an upgrade
                called Reach which increases the distance of the teleportation, which I personally feel is necessary
                as the base distance isn't useful for much but perhaps giving yourself an extra jump distance. Speaking
                of jumps another upgrade that is useful when trying to get the most distance out of the Shift slab is
                the airborne upgrade, it will allow you to stay suspended in air for a brief moment of time while
                you decide where to teleport to, this is useful for using your double jump from
                <a href="trinkets.html#spring-heel">Spring Heel</a> to get some base distance and adding onto it with Shift.

            <h3 class="Section-Header" id="aether">Aether</h3>
            <img class="image-flow-left" src="assets/Aether.jpg" width="620px" alt="Image of Aether Slab">
            <p>
                The Aether slab allows the player to temporarily go invisible, however this comes at a high power cost
                the Aether and <a href="#nexus">Nexus</a> slabs are the most power hungry slabs in the game - and for
                good reason. Using the Aether slab you can avoid a ton of confrontation with enemies as well as assist
                you in quick getaways. Now while this might make it sound like the Aether slab is overpowered it's not.
                Normally the Aether slab constantly drains power while active and deactivates if the player takes damage
                or attacks. However, if equipped the ghost upgrade prevents power draining while the player is not moving,
                the flicker upgrade prevents the power from deactivating when attacking but instead the player is briefly
                visible hence the name &ldquo;flicker&rdquo;, and finally the phase upgrade prevents the power from
                deactivating when taking damage and even reduces the amount of damage taken. But this is still all at the
                cost of losing a lot of power really quickly.

            <img class="image-flow-right" src="assets/Karnesis.jpg" width="620px" alt="Image of Karnesis Slab">
            <p>
                The Karnesis slab allows the players, as one of the Visionaries Aleksis Dorsey says <q>play with
                their meat</q> - he's a cannibal by the way. Using this ability allows the player to telepathically
                throw enemies in any direction. This on its own is very fun to use but not very useful when it comes
                to multiple enemies rushing you at once. But that is where the zone upgrade comes in, using this upgrade
                allows the player to throw multiple enemies in an area at once rather than one at a time. If you combine
                this with the flesh bomb upgrade, which causes enemies to explode upon reaching the ground you can have a
                devastating AOE attack for those times when you need a breather.

            <h3 class="Section-Header" id="nexus">Nexus</h3>
            <img class="image-flow-left" src="assets/Nexus.jpg" width="620px" alt="Image of Nexus Slab">
            <p>
                The Nexus slab allows the player to &ldquo;Link&rdquo; enemies so that whatever happens to one
                happens to all linked enemies i.e. if you kick one off a cliff they all go flying in the same
                direction. As Mentioned earlier this along with the <a href="#aether">Aether</a> slab are the
                most power hungry ones in the game. The ability takes one full bar of power when shooting one link
                bomb - for lack of better description, and constantly drains power when enemies are linked. But
                there are some upgrades to help ease this ability's hunger - the Protraction upgrade, which reduces
                the amount of power that the ability uses. I personally also choose to run the Parasite upgrade, which
                heals the player whenever a linked enemy is damaged. This ability abuses your power bar, but I personally
                think that it is very much worth it especially if running a power based loadout with character trinkets
                like <a href="trinkets.html#renewable">Renewable</a> and <a href="trinkets.html#juiced-up">Juiced Up</a>
                which increase the speed that power regenerates and increases your maximum power respectively.

            <h3 class="Section-Header" id="havoc">Havoc</h3>
            <img class="image-flow-right" src="assets/Havoc.jpg" width="620px" alt="Image of Havoc Slab">
            <p class="last-paragraph">
                The Havoc slab allows the player to enter a &ldquo;berserk&rdquo; state in which they take less
                damage and inflict more damage. This is fairly useful when facing off against a crowd of enemies
                or even just one very powerful enemy. This slab does take a substantial amount of power and although
                not anywhere near as much as the heavy hitters <a href="#aether">Aether</a> and
                <a href="#nexus">Nexus</a> but it still takes its toll. To counteract this however you can equip the
                withdrawal upgrade which allows you to gain power back by damaging enemies. There is also the euphoria
                upgrade which increases the amount of damage you give as you take more damage, I personally do not use
                Havoc as it is not my play style, so I cannot attest to how well these upgrades pair up together.
