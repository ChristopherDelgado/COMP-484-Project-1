            <h3>IGN</h3>
            <p>IGN gives Deathloop a score of 10/10. The game tells it's story with
            the overused audio logs and files however as IGN states
            they are <q>concise, deeply flavourful, and often surprisingly funny</q>.
            Although audio logs and files in most games are used to tell some backstory
            of the world to the player, in Deathloop they play very detrimental roles
            not finding some audio log or file can prevent the player from finding
            clues to help them kill their targets, they also provide backstory on
            the 8 Visionaries which you are out to kill. IGN can attest to the latter,
            they write:</p> <blockquote>&ldquo;Directly tying objectives to these diaries and
            messages means each new discovery further develops an authentic antagonistic
            relationship between you and the Visionaries as you play, rather than having a
            manufactured one dropped in your lap.&rdquo;</blockquote>
