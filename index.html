                    <b>IGN</b> gives Deathloop a score of 10/10. The game tells it's story with
                    the overused audio logs and files however as <b>IGN</b> states
                    they are <q cite="https://www.ign.com/articles/deathloop-review">concise, deeply flavourful,
                        and often surprisingly funny</q>.
                    Although audio logs and files in most games are used to tell some backstory
                    of the world to the player, in Deathloop they play very detrimental roles
                    not finding some audio log or file can prevent the player from finding
                    clues to help them kill their targets, they also provide backstory on
                    the 8 Visionaries which you are out to kill. <b>IGN</b> can attest to the latter,
                    they write: <blockquote cite="https://www.ign.com/articles/deathloop-review">&ldquo;Directly
                    tying objectives to these diaries and
                    messages means each new discovery further develops an authentic antagonistic
                    relationship between you and the Visionaries as you play, rather than having a
                    manufactured one dropped in your lap.&rdquo;</blockquote> you can read the full review here

                <h3 class="Section-Header">My Opinion</h3>
                <p>
                    I personally think that DeathLoop is an amazing game! First it really takes the whole
                    learn from your mistakes thing and runs with it well. And while you might think that basically
                    playing the same levels over and over might get boring, trust me when I say <em>it doesn't</em>
                    multiple times I have found myself going back to the same areas with new
                    <a href="trinkets.html">trinkets</a> and finding new paths accessible or new weapons that I
                    couldn't reach before. For example <strong>SPOILER WARNING:</strong> when following one of the
                    Visionary Leads there is a section that requires you to turn off some beer taps but while doing this
                    you have to cross a hallway full of mines and tripwires while also avoiding getting seen by nearby
                    enemies. Initially I found this incredibly difficult and could not get it done - as you have to reset
                    if you fail - but after finding the right combination of <a href="slabs.html">slabs</a> and trinkets
                    I was able to pull it off. I took with me the <a href="slabs.html#aether">Aether slab</a> with the
                    ghost and flicker upgrades as well as the <a href="trinkets.html#mine-own">Mine Own</a> character trinket.
                    With this specific loadout I was finally able to finish that lead, and I think that this truly points out
                    what DeathLoop is all about. Killing, Looting, Looping, with different loadouts for different results.
