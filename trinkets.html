            <p>
              The Spring&nbsp;Heel trinket is actually your first trinket in game, and is given too you at the start of every
              single loop. It allows the player to be able to which can be very useful for extending your reach with the
              <a href="slabs.html#shift">Shift</a> slab. I personally always run this trinket which honestly bothers me,
              since I feel like I shouldn't have to waste a trinket space for the ability to double jump in a game where
              teleportation exists. I feel like double jump should just be given to you at that point, but it is still
              useful, so I keep it.

            <img class="flow-left" src="assets/Never-Say-Die.jpg" width="620px">
            <p>
              The Never&nbsp;Say&nbsp;Die trinket increases the player&apos;s health, the amount increased is determined
              by the rarity of the trinket itself. The one on the picture to the left is a purple-tier variant, so it gives
              you the max health possible. Which is three small extra bars of health that are equal to about 75&percnt; more
              health. I personally always run this trinket, I love to go into situations with stealth but if I get caught I
              like to make sure I can tank through the enemies shots.

            <img class="flow-right" src="assets/Juiced-Up.jpg" width="620px">
            <p>
              The Juiced&nbsp;Up trinket increases the player&apos;s total power, the amount by which it is increased
              is like Never&nbsp;Say&nbsp;Die dependent on the rarity of the trinket. The one in the picture to the right
              is a purple-tier variant, so it adds an extra bar of power and increases the sides of the new four total bars,
              increasing your power by approximately 50&percnt;. I personally try to always keep this trinket equipped since
              I like to run a loadout that maximizes power output and regeneration, but It is the second to go if I have to
              equip a different trinket to get through some portion of a loop.

            <img class="flow-left" src="assets/Renewable.jpg" width="620px">
            <p>
              The Renewable trinket increases the speed of the player&apos;s power regeneration this effect is also dependent
              on the trinket&apos;s rarity. I personally try to always keep this trinket equipped since, like I previously
              mentioned I like to max out my power output and regeneration, however it is the first trinket to get replaced
              if I need to equip another for any reason.

            <img class="flow-right" src="assets/Mine-Own.jpg" width="620px">
            <p>
              The Mine&nbsp;Own trinket allows the player to hack enemy explosives. This is incredibly useful in some situations
              where almost every inch of ground is littered with dozens of mines. After the explosives are hacked the player can
              run straight through them without fear of setting them off, or detonate them on command - HOWEVER the player is
              still susceptible to any explosive damage caused by the hacked explosives. I personally only ever equip
              Mine&nbsp;Own when I know that I will need it.

          <h4 class="Section-Header" id="lightning-strike">Lightning Strike</h4>
          <img class="flow-right" src="assets/Lightning-Strike.jpg" width="620px">
          <p>
            The Lightning&nbsp;Strike trinket increases the range at which the weapon equipped with it can do full damage
            this effect of course like all trinkets is determined by it&apos;s rarity. I personally like to always equip
            one of these on my <a href="weapons.html#spiker">PT-6</a> so that I can silently kill enemies from far distances.
            However, you can also equip to other weapons just to increase their damage range which I also do with the
            <a href="weapons.html#sepulchra-breteira">Sepulchra&nbsp;Breteira</a> to give me even greater damage range.

          <h4 class="Section-Header" id="hailfire">Hailfire</h4>
          <img class="flow-left" src="assets/Hailfire.jpg" width="620px">
          <p>
            The Hailfire trinket increases the rate&nbsp;of&nbsp;fire of the weapon that has it equipped, using this you can greatly
            increase your weapon&apos;s <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr>. However, be warned that a higher
            rate&nbsp;of&nbsp;fire also means less control of your weapon. I personally still use it though, typically with weapons
            that have high firing rates on their own to push them to the edge. I have it paired on my <a href="weapons.html#limp">LIMP-10</a>
            with the Vampire perk so that I have a high <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr> and faster health regeneration.

          <h4 class="Section-Header" id="big-box">Big Box</h4>
          <img class="flow-right" src="assets/Big-Box.jpg" width="620px">
          <p>
            The Big Box trinket increases the amount of bullets held in the magazine of the weapon equipped with it.
            Since you can only carry a limited amount of each type of ammunition this is an incredibly useful trinket.
            If paired with the Hailfire trinket you can shoot for longer before having to reload. I have personally noticed
            that the purple-variant of the trinket increases your ammo count by 18 for the <a href="weapons.html#limp">LIMP-10</a>,
            but this changed dependent on the weapon it is equipped on.

          <h4 class="Section-Header" id="perforator">Perforator</h4>
          <img class="flow-left" src="assets/Perforator.jpg" width="620px">
          <p>
            The Perforator trinket allows the bullets, of the weapon equipped with it, to penetrate enemies and keep going
            which is useful for shooting enemies behind others. Perfect for narrow hallways. I keep it equipped on my
            <a href="weapons.html#sepulchra-breteira">Sepulchra Breteira</a> to allow for well lined multi-kills.
