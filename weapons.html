        <p>
          The PT-6 &apos;Spiker&apos; can be found very early on in your playthrough of DeathLoop. This is one of the best weapons to keep in
          your arsenal if your planning on using a stealthy approach. The PT-6 is literally just a nail gun, plain and simple. The PT-6 can be
          charged by holding down the trigger which can increase the distance that the nail will travel as well as the damage that it will do.
          Typically, a shot to the head with the PT-6 is an instant kill. But this depends on the distance to the enemy as well as if they are
          wearing a helmet or not. I personally run a PT-6 equipped with <a href="trinkets.html#lightning-strike">Lightning&nbsp;Strike</a>,
          Sure&nbsp;Shot, and Shock&nbsp;Absorber Weapon Trinkets. Using Lightning&nbsp;Strike increases the distance at which the weapon
          equipped with it does full damage. Since I run the PT-6 as my main silent weapon this helps to be able to instantly kill far away
          enemies with a silent headshot I also run a specific version of the PT-6 with the Marked&nbsp;For&nbsp;Death perk which does bonus
          damage to tagged enemies.

        <video class="flow-left" controls controlsList="nodownload" src="assets/LIMP-10-clip.mp4" poster="assets/LIMP-10.jpg" width="620px">Video of LIMP-10</video>
        <p>
          When you first start DeathLoop your initial weapon is actually a <abbr Title="Light Infantry Machine Pistol">LIMP</abbr>-10,
          albeit a low grey-tier perkless version that jams a lot. However, the higher tiers of this &ldquo;basic&rdquo; weapon are well
          worth using. There are many versions of this weapon all with different perks, there exists one with a Suppressor perk which reduces
          the amount of noise the weapon makes when fired, and another with an Open Wound perk that causes bleeding damage so that enemies take
          damage over time after being shot and those are just the ones that I have personally found. The one in the picture to the left is a
          purple rarity LIMP-10 with the Vampire perk which heals the player when they damage enemies, this is especially useful for players
          with a run and gun loadout. I personally like to pair it with the <a href="trinkets.html#hailfire">Hailfire</a>,
          <a href="trinkets.html#lightning-strike">Lightning&nbsp;Strike</a>, and <a href="trinkets.html#big-box">Big&nbsp;Box</a> weapon trinkets, using
          this specific loadout allows for fast health regeneration and high <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr>. Paired with a purple-tiered
          <a href="trinkets.html#never-say-die">Never&nbsp;Say&nbsp;Die</a> trinket for maximum health leads to an <em>almost</em> invincible set up.

        <h3 class="Section-Header" id="strelak-verso">Strelak Verso</h3>
        <video class="flow-right" controls controlsList="nodownload" src="assets/Strelak-Verso-Clip.mp4" poster="assets/Strelak-Verso.jpg" width="620px">Video of Strelak Verso</video>
        <p>
          The Strelak Verso is one of the legendary weapons that can be found within the world of DeathLoop. I won't spoil where and how to find it
          but I will say it is possible to get it in your very first loop - which I did, unfortunately since your initial loops are linear and set up
          the story you won&apos;t be able to keep it - which is also exactly what happened to me. However since the game just loops continously you
          can always go back and grab it at any time you want. The weapons, yes plural, themselves look like simple dual wield handguns however,
          they can combine to form one burst sub-machine gun. I typically run these weapons with the <a href="trinkets.html#hailfire">Hailfire</a>, and
          <a href="trinkets.html#big-box">Big&nbsp;Box</a> weapon trinkets for sure, and the third perk is never really set in stone. I personally have the
          red and silver variant of the weapons, but there is also a shiny pink variant which I personally think looks better.

        <h3 class="Section-Header" id="sepulchra-breteira">Sepulchra Breteira</h3>
        <video class="flow-left" controls controlsList="nodownload" src="assets/Sepulchra-Breteira-Clip.mp4" poster="assets/Sepulchra-Breteira.jpg" width="620px">Video of Sepulchra Breteria</video>
        <p>
          The Sepulchra Breteira is a literal gift wrapped with a bow in a beautiful wrapping paper. This is the only sniper rifle within the world of DeathLoop,
          now it still does make a ton of noise, and you will attract the attention of every single enemy near you when fired however the amount of range on the
          Sepulchra Breteira makes up for it. You don&apos;t have to be anywhere near the enemies to kill enemies from afar. I personally like to run it with the
          <a href="trinkets.html#lightning-strike">Lightning&nbsp;Stike</a>, <a href="trinkets.html#perforator">Perforator</a>, and Crack&nbsp;Shot perks. Using
          these I increase the distance at which the Sepulchra Breteira does full damage and give myself even more room between me and my targets, and with Perforator
          my shots will go through enemies and hit enemies on the other side of them. The perk on my variant is the Explosive Decapitation perk which causes explosions
          whenever you land a headshot. There is also another variant that I am trying to get with the Coiled Snake perk which gives the Sepulchra Breteira an effect
          similar to the <a href="#spiker">PT-6</a> where you can charge the shots for increased damage.
